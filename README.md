jute
====

This repository contains code relating to the jute blockchain construction. The
'simple' folder contains a basic, computationally expensive but easy to
understand implementation of the jute algorithm.

Eventually, this repository will also house some simulation code for generating
network graphs, as well as a 'fast' folder which will contain an optimized but
more difficult to understand implementation of the jute consensus algorithm.

Eventually eventually there will be an altcoin for testing out the power of
jute in an actual blockchain environment.
